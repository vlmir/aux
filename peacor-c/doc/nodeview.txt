### nodeview-0.1 ###

## Function:
provides basic node attributes such as degree, clustering coefficient, eigen vector centrality
nodes are optionally filted by node weights

## Input:
adjacency matrix, white space delimited: varLabel1, varLabel2, edgeWeight

## Output:
tab delimited: nodeID, nodeWeight, nodeDegree, nodeClustering, nodeCentrality; STDOUT

## Usage:
./nodeview.py [-cdehv] [-p <float> | -w <float>] -i <string>
# Options:
-c: compute clustering
-d: compute degree
-e: compute eigen vector centrality
-h: print help
-i: input adjacency matrix
-p: percent of top nodes to print: (0,100) exclusive
-v: print version
-w: node weight cutoff for printing: (0,1) exclusive
# Examples:
./nodeview.py -h
./nodeview.py -cde -i adjacency.tsv
./nodeview.py -cde -p 50 -i adjacency.tsv

## Restrictions:
'-c' requires all edge weights to be be non-negative
'-p' and '-w' are mutually exclusive

## Comments:
- implemented to operate equally under Python 2 and Python 3
- if one of the "-cde" options is omitted the corresponding values are not computed and set to 0.0 in the output
- all node attributes are weighted
- node weghts are computed as the mean of absolute values of adjoining edge weghts

## Dependencies:
networkx Python library
> sudo pip install networkx
